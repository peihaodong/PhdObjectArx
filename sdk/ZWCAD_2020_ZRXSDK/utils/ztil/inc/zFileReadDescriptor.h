// FileReadDescriptor is constructed by specifying the name of a file containing an image. 
// The file passed in to the FileReadDescriptor constructor should point to a valid file that contains 
// a readable image.
//
// The FileReadDescriptor class includes a static method, isDecodableFile(), which should be used 
// to determine whether a given file contains a readable image.
//
// Some image files can contain multiple images. In ZTIL, we refer to each image within a single 
// file as a "frame". FileReadDescriptor can only refer to one frame at any one time. FileReadDescriptor 
// will return the number of frames contained in an open file, and will allow the user to select which 
// frame the FileReadDescriptor will refer to.
